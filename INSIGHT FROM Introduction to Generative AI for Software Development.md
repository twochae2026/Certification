Yeah. It's like I found myself, I'm sitting down and I'm enjoying coding much more than I had been previously, because I'm spending more time thinking about the problem that I'm working on and thinking about how to implement that, solve that problem, as opposed to what do I do for user interface, what do I do for a docker container to push to the cloud and those types of things. It's really fun.
